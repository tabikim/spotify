#spotify

1. What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?

	My project allows you to create or login to your spotify account and look for tracks related to the input as well as preview the track.

2. What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?

	https://students.washington.edu/tabikim/info343/spotify

3. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.

	Mason and I worked together a bit!

4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

	~15 hours

5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
	
	The most difficult part was implementing the spotify web api end reference points. Also, deciding on what to do for this project. I think it would be better to give more clarification on how to implement web API's before us handling one.
